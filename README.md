# SPRINGBOOT-API-REST ðŸš€

## Overview
Welcome to the "SPRINGBOOT-API-REST" repository! This project is a practice exercise completed during the course "Spring Boot 3: desarrollar una API Rest en Java" offered by Alura Latam and Oracle. The repository focuses on building a RESTful API using Spring Boot in Java.

## Technologies Used
The project incorporates various technologies and tools including:

- **Flyway**: Used for database schema migration to ensure consistency.
- **Hibernate**: Provides an easy-to-use ORM framework for mapping Java objects to database tables.
- **Insomnia**: A powerful API testing tool to facilitate API development and testing.
- **Java 17**: Harnessing the capabilities of the latest Java version for efficient development.
- **Spring Boot**: Enhancing productivity by simplifying the development of Java applications.
- **JPL**: Java Persistence Language for managing database interactions.
- **Lombok-Maven**: A tool to reduce boilerplate code and enhance Java development.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool for managing project dependencies.
- **MySQL Database**: Used as the backend database to store and manage API data.
